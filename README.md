Mars Photos
==================================

Mars Photos app is a demo app that shows actual images of Mars' surface. The data is stored on a Web server
as a REST web service.

Learned the use of Retrofit to make REST requests to the web service, Gson serialization to
handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and Coil to load images by URL into a LazyGridColumn.
Also learned the use of Coroutines to load data on seperate thread in order to not block the Main thread.
